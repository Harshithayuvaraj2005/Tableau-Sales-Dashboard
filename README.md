This dashboard required sophisticated handling of the dataset to achieve the final insights:

1.  **Data Union:** Performed a **Union of three separate sales sheets** (e.g., Q1, Q2, Q3) to consolidate the data into a single, comprehensive source for analysis. This ensured all data was integrated correctly.
2.  **Filtering & Conditional Logic:** Implemented **multiple filters** (e.g., Region, Product Category) to allow users to dynamically segment the data. Used calculated fields to apply **conditional logic** to specific metrics.
3.  **Visualization Variety:** Built a variety of charts, including:
    * **Geographical Map:** Visualizing sales and profit contribution by country/region.
    * **Trend Graphs:** Line charts to track performance over time.
    * **Bar/Pie Charts:** Comparing categorical data (e.g., product performance).
4.  **Dashboard Design:** Designed the final layout to ensure a clear **information hierarchy** and an intuitive user experience.

## 📊 Project Goal

The primary analytical goal was to identify and visualize **regional performance** and **seasonal trends** across the combined dataset.
